<p>Céu provides <em>Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming</em> with the following
general characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Reactive</em>:    code executes in reactions to events.</li>
<li><em>Structured</em>:  code uses structured control-flow mechanisms, such as <code>spawn</code>
                 and <code>await</code> (to create and suspend lines of execution).</li>
<li><em>Synchronous</em>: event reactions run atomically and to completion on each line
                 of execution.</li>
</ul>
<!--
- Event Handling:
    - An `await` statement to suspend a line of execution and wait for an input
      event from the environment.
    - An `emit` statement to signal an output event back to the environment.
- Concurrency:
    - A set of parallel constructs to compose concurrent lines of execution.
-->

<p>The lines of execution in Céu, known as <em>trails</em>, react all together to input
events one after another, in discrete steps.
An input event is broadcast to all active trails, which share the event as an
unique and global time reference.</p>
<p>The example in Céu that follows blinks a LED every second and terminates on a
button press:</p>
<pre><code class="ceu">input  none   BUTTON;
output on/off LED;
par/or do
    await BUTTON;
with
    loop do
        await 1s;
        emit LED(on);
        await 1s;
        emit LED(off);
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The synchronous concurrency model of Céu greatly diverges from multithreaded
and actor-based models (e.g. <em>pthreads</em> and <em>erlang</em>).
On the one hand, there is no preemption or real parallelism at the synchronous
core of the language (i.e., no multi-core execution).
On the other hand, accesses to shared variables among trails are deterministic
and do not require synchronization primitives (i.e., <em>locks</em> or
<em>queues</em>).</p>
<p>Céu provides static memory management based on lexical scope and does not
require a garbage collector.</p>
<p>Céu integrates safely with C, particularly when manipulating external resources
(e.g., file handles).
Programs can make native calls seamlessly while avoiding common pitfalls such
as memory leaks and dangling pointers.</p>
<p>Céu is <a href="./license/#license">free software</a>.</p>
<h2 id="environments">Environments<a class="headerlink" href="#environments" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>As a reactive language, Céu depends on an external host platform, known as an
<em>environment</em>, which exposes <code>input</code> and <code>output</code> events programs can use.</p>
<p>An environment senses the world and broadcasts <code>input</code> events to programs.
It also intercepts programs signalling <code>output</code> events to actuate in the
world:</p>
<p><img alt="An environment works as a bridge between the program and the real world." src="./overview/environment.png" /></p>
<p>As examples of typical environments, an embedded system may provide button
input and LED output, and a video game engine may provide keyboard input and
video output.</p>

<h2 id="synchronous-execution-model">Synchronous Execution Model<a class="headerlink" href="#synchronous-execution-model" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Céu is grounded on a precise notion of <em>logical time</em> (as opposed to
<em>physical</em>) as a discrete sequence of input events:
a sequence because only a single input event is handled at a logical time; 
discrete because reactions to events are guaranteed to execute in bounded
physical time (see <a href="#bounded-execution">Bounded Execution</a>).</p>
<p>The execution model for Céu programs is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The program initiates the <em>boot reaction</em> from the first line of code in a
   single trail.</li>
<li>Active trails, one after another, execute until they await or terminate.
   This step is named a <em>reaction chain</em>, and always runs in bounded time.
   New trails can be created with
   <a href="#parallel-compositions-and-abortion">parallel compositions</a>.</li>
<li>The program goes idle.</li>
<li>On the occurrence of a new input event, <em>all</em> trails awaiting that event
   awake.
   It then goes to step 2.</li>
</ol>
<p>The synchronous execution model of Céu is based on the hypothesis that reaction
chains run <em>infinitely faster</em> in comparison to the rate of input events.
A reaction chain, aka <em>external reaction</em>, is the set of computations that
execute when an input event occurs.
Conceptually, a program takes no time on step 2 and is always idle on step 3.
In practice, if a new input event occurs while a reaction chain is 
running (step 2), it is enqueued to run in the next reaction.
When multiple trails are active at a logical time (i.e. awaking from the same 
event), Céu schedules them in the order they appear in the program text.
This policy is arbitrary, but provides a priority scheme for trails, and also
ensures deterministic and reproducible execution for programs.
At any time, at most one trail is executing.</p>
<p>The program and diagram that follow illustrate the behavior of the scheduler of
Céu:</p>
<pre><code class="ceu"> 1:  input none A;
 2:  input none B;
 3:  input none C;
 4:  par/and do
 5:      // trail 1
 6:      &lt;...&gt;          // a `&lt;...&gt;` represents non-awaiting statements
 7:      await A;       // (e.g., assignments and native calls)
 8:      &lt;...&gt;
 9:  with
10:      // trail 2
11:      &lt;...&gt;
12:      await B;
13:      &lt;...&gt;
14:  with
15:      // trail 3
16:      &lt;...&gt;
17:      await A;
18:      &lt;...&gt;
19:      await B;
20:      par/and do
21:          // trail 3
22:          &lt;...&gt;
23:      with
24:          // trail 4
25:          &lt;...&gt;
26:      end
27:  end
</code></pre>

<p><img alt="" src="./overview/reaction.png" /></p>
<p>The program starts in the boot reaction and forks into three trails.
Respecting the lexical order of declaration for the trails, they are scheduled
as follows (<em>t0</em> in the diagram):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>trail-1</em> executes up to the <code>await A</code> (line 7);</li>
<li><em>trail-2</em> executes up to the <code>await B</code> (line 12);</li>
<li><em>trail-3</em> executes up to the <code>await A</code> (line 17).</li>
</ul>
<p>As no other trails are pending, the reaction chain terminates and the scheduler 
remains idle until a new event occurs (<em>t1=A</em> in the diagram):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>trail-1</em> awakes, executes and terminates (line 8);</li>
<li><em>trail-2</em> remains suspended, as it is not awaiting <code>A</code>.</li>
<li><em>trail-3</em> executes up to <code>await B</code> (line 19).</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that during the reaction <em>t1</em>, new instances of events <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>C</code>
occur which are all enqueued to be handled in the reactions in sequence.
As <code>A</code> happened first, it becomes the next reaction.
However, no trails are awaiting it, so an empty reaction chain takes place 
(<em>t2</em> in the diagram).
The next reaction dequeues the event <code>B</code> (<em>t3</em> in the diagram):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>trail-2</em> awakes, executes and terminates;</li>
<li><em>trail-3</em> splits in two and they both terminate immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since a <code>par/and</code> rejoins after all trails terminate, the program also
terminates and does not react to the pending event <code>C</code>.</p>
<p>Note that each step in the logical time line (<em>t0</em>, <em>t1</em>, etc.) is identified 
by the unique occurring event.
Inside a reaction, trails only react to the same shared global event (or remain 
suspended).</p>
<!--
A reaction chain may also contain emissions and reactions to internal events, 
which are presented in Section~\ref{sec.ceu.ints}.
-->

<h2 id="parallel-compositions-and-abortion">Parallel Compositions and Abortion<a class="headerlink" href="#parallel-compositions-and-abortion" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>The use of trails in parallel allows programs to wait for multiple events at 
the same time.
Céu supports three kinds of parallel compositions that differ in how they
rejoin and proceed to the statement in sequence:</p>
<ol>
<li>a <code>par/and</code> rejoins after all trails in parallel terminate;</li>
<li>a <code>par/or</code> rejoins after any trail in parallel terminates, aborting all
   other trails automatically;</li>
<li>a <code>par</code> never rejoins, even if all trails terminate.</li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned in the introduction and emphasized in the execution model, trails
in parallel do not execute with real parallelism.
Therefore, it is important to note that parallel compositions support
<em>awaiting in parallel</em>, rather than <em>executing in parallel</em> (see
<a href="./statements/#thread">Asynchronous Threads</a> for real parallelism support).
<!--
The termination of a trail inside a <code>par/or</code> aborts the other trails in 
parallel which are necessarily idle
(see <a href="#synchronous-execution-model">klzzwxh:0034 for external reactions</a>).
Before being aborted, a trail has a last opportunity to execute active 
<a href="#TODO">finalization statements</a>.
--></p>
<h2 id="bounded-execution">Bounded Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#bounded-execution" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Reaction chains must run in bounded time to guarantee that programs are 
responsive and can handle incoming input events.
For this reason, Céu requires every path inside the body of a <code>loop</code> statement
to contain at least one <code>await</code> or <code>break</code> statement.
This prevents <em>tight loops</em>, which are unbounded loops that do not await.</p>
<p>In the example that follow, if the condition is false, the true branch of the
<code>if</code> never executes, resulting in a tight loop:</p>
<pre><code class="ceu">loop do
    if &lt;cond&gt; then
        break;
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Céu warns about tight loops in programs at compile time.
For computationally-intensive algorithms that require unrestricted loops (e.g.,
cryptography, image processing), Céu provides
<a href="./statements/#asynchronous-execution">Asynchronous Execution</a>.</p>
<h2 id="deterministic-execution">Deterministic Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#deterministic-execution" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p><code>TODO (shared memory + deterministic scheduler + optional static analysis)</code></p>
<h2 id="internal-reactions">Internal Reactions<a class="headerlink" href="#internal-reactions" title="Permanent link">&para;</a></h2>
<p>Céu supports inter-trail communication through <code>await</code> and <code>emit</code> statements
for <em>internal events</em>.
A trail can <code>await</code> an internal event to suspend it.
Then, another trail can <code>emit</code> and broadcast an event, awaking all trails
awaiting that event.</p>
<p>Unlike input events, multiple internal events can coexist during an external
reaction.
An <code>emit</code> starts a new <em>internal reaction</em> in the program which relies on a
runtime stack:</p>
<ol>
<li>The <code>emit</code> suspends the current trail and its continuation is pushed into
    the stack (i.e., the statement in sequence with the <code>emit</code>).</li>
<li>All trails awaiting the emitted event awake and execute in sequence
    (see <a href="#synchronous-execution-model"><code>rule 2</code></a> for external reactions).
    If an awaking trail emits another internal event, a nested internal
    reaction starts with <code>rule 1</code>.</li>
<li>The top of the stack is popped and the last emitting trail resumes execution
    from its continuation.</li>
</ol>
<p>The program as follow illustrates the behavior of internal reactions in Céu:</p>
<pre><code class="ceu">1:  par/and do      // trail 1
2:      await e;
3:      emit f;
4:  with            // trail 2
5:      await f;
6:  with            // trail 3
7:      emit e;
8:  end
</code></pre>

<p>The program starts in the boot reaction with an empty stack and forks into the
three trails.
Respecting the lexical order, the first two trails <code>await</code> and the third trail
executes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>emit e</code> in <em>trail-3</em> (line 7) starts an internal reaction (<code>stack=[7]</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>await e</code> in <em>trail-1</em> awakes (line 2) and then the <code>emit f</code> (line 3)
  starts another internal reaction (<code>stack=[7,3]</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>await f</code> in <em>trail-2</em> awakes and terminates the trail (line 5).
  Since no other trails are awaiting <code>f</code>, the current internal reaction
  terminates, resuming and popping the top of the stack (<code>stack=[7]</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>emit f</code> resumes in <em>trail-1</em> and terminates the trail (line 3).
  The current internal reaction terminates, resuming and popping the top of the
  stack (<code>stack=[]</code>).</li>
<li>The <code>emit e</code> resumes in <em>trail-3</em> and terminates the trail (line 7).
  Finally, the <code>par/and</code> rejoins and the program terminates.</li>
</ul>
